description: >-
  the concept of “truth” materializes in a human-shaped figure standing straight
  in front of the viewer. the entire composition is built on a vertical symmetry
  that gives a very powerful appearance to the painting. one more original
  feature is the great contrast between warm and cold colours, from saturated
  red-orange to very dark blue.
