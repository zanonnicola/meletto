title: power of illusions
subtitle: 'oil on canvas, 40x40, 2012'
description: >-
  this powerful painting was made in 2012 as part of the first collection. a
  watery, blurred background creates an ethereal setting on which the subject
  was painted with energetic thick brush strokes. the power of illusions is
  represented as an elegant human-shaped figure posing on the ground in front of
  the viewer. all shades of blue and green are combined with rapid strokes of
  red, white and gold to create a bright, vivid composition.
