description: >-
  this painting was made in london in 2018. the entire composition is built on a
  strong oblique line force made by the subject that is not recognizing itself
  anymore, questioning its true nature. the figure is involved in a dynamic
  vortex made by harsh brush strokes that creates a very energetic scene.
