  translated as “rain”, this colourful painting was made using a distorted
  perspective that gives a very dynamic effect to the composition. the elegant
  figure is holding its right hand up as for understanding if it is raining or
  not. the colour palette used that includes several shades of blue and green
  with a touch of pink and red to add a vibrant contrast.
