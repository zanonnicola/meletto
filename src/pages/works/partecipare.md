description: >-
  as suggested by the title, the subject represented on canvas is the feeling of
  participating, the sensation of taking part in something. colourful brush
  strokes follow dynamic line forces to create the illusion of being in a
  surreal tunnel. this vibrant ambience is constant movement and filled with
  light and vivid colours.
