title: dinamismo di un batterista
subtitle: '50x70, 2009/2012'
description: >-
  part of the second collection, this original composition is a portrait of a
  drummer. it consists of several layers of oil colours that were created in
  different moments between 2009 and 2012. this thick stratification helps to
  create a great texture made by energic brush strokes. the entire painting is
  built on tense curved force lines that produce great dynamism and rhythm, as
  representing the sound produced by the drums.
