title: 'power of illusions #3'
subtitle: 'oil on wood, 48x80, 2019'
description: >-
  infinite brush strokes build this vibrant composition with an explosion of
  saturated colours. the power of illusions is represented as an elegant
  human-shaped figure that seems to expand its physical limits to be part of the
  background and vice versa. on the canvas, everything becomes chaos in constant
  movement.
