subtitle: 'oil on canvas, 40x80, 2013'
description: >-
  this painting was made in 2013 to represent a desk surface seen from a high
  point of view using an exasperated perspective that creates a very dynamic
  effect. from this viewpoint, all objects on the top of the desk become
  gigantic as if they were buildings of an imaginary urban space where the
  viewer is projected in.
