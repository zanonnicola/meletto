description: >-
  translated as “the white room”, this painting was made in 2013 as part of the
  first collection. the subject is an interior ambience that, in contrast with
  the title, is represented as a very colourful room. the entire composition is
  built using a central perspective with the brush strokes converging to the
  centre, creating a really energetic design. the canvas has been left white all
  around the borders, another original feature of this painting.
