description: >-
  part of the first collection, this canvas represents two people walking
  through the forest of golden gate park. the moment has been extremely
  dramatized by energetic brush strokes that follow rhythmic patterns of curved
  and straight lines. saturated shades of blue and green fill the canvas while
  strokes of white red and purple enhance the colourful impact of the
  composition for the viewer.
