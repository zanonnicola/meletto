description: >-
  this squared canvas is part of the second collection. it was painted in london
  combining shades of yellow and green oil colours. thick brush strokes fill the
  entire surface of the canvas and define the subject of the painting, on the
  right, sitting on the border of an infinite artificial sheer drop. on the left
  side, a primordial second figure emerges from the background giving a very
  enigmatic tone to the composition.
