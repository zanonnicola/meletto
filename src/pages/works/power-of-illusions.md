description: >-
  this powerful painting was made in 2012 as part of the first collection. a
  watery, blurred background creates an ethereal setting on which the subject
  was painted with energetic thick brush strokes. the power of illusions is
  represented as an elegant human-shaped figure posing on the ground in front of
  the viewer.
