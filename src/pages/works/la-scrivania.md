subtitle: 'oil on canvas, 50x60, 2009'
description: >-
  this canvas was painted in 2009 as part of the first collection. as suggested
  from the title (“the desk”) it represents a desk surface from a very low
  perspective. thanks to this original point of view, all objects on the top of
  the desk become gigantic as if they were buildings of an imaginary urban space
  where the viewer is projected in. the convergent brush strokes and the broad
  colour palette makes this composition vibrant and very dynamic.
