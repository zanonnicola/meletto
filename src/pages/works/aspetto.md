  Part of the second colection, this piece is hand painted on canvas. It's got a
  great contemporary feel, with large, thick brush strokes. This painting has
  several oil layers that build up the colour and shape, including interesting
  brush strokes that add interest when seen up close. It is finished with chalk
  pastel marks to add unique edge.
