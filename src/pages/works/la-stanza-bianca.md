description: >-
  translated as “the white room”, this painting was made in 2013 as part of the
  first collection. the subject is an interior ambience that, in contrast with
  the title, is represented as a very colourful room. the entire composition is
  built using a central perspective creating a really energetic design. the
  canvas has been left white all around the borders, another original feature of
  this painting.
