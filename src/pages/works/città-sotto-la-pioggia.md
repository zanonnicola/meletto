description: >-
  translated as “the city under the rain”, the colour palette of this painting
  consists of a great variety of cold colours and in a little part of dark
  yellow and brown. a particular feature of the composition is that a couple of
  parts, represented by two windows, have been painted in black and white to
  represent the scene seen from an interior ambience.
