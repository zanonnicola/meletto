description: >-
  this triptych titled “tre anime” (three souls) consists of three vertical
  paintings representing different moods using sceneries as metaphors. the three
  subjects that name each of the canvases are “the sky”, “the earth” and “the
  sea”. they are illustrated as human-shaped figures following a very specific
  compositional style and colour scheme in order to create a coherent unique
  composition.
