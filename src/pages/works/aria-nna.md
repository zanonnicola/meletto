description: >-
  all shades of warm colours come together in this energetic composition. part
  of the second collection, it is a portrait of a singer named arianna. several
  layers of nervous brush strokes build the figure with colour and shape
  creating the perfect representation of her dynamic personality. this unique
  painting was hand painted with oil colours and pastels on canvas as a
  universal celebration of music.
