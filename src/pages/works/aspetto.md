description: >-
  translated as “i wait”, this particular painting was made in 2016. the subject
  is portrayed in two different moments at the same time, a feature that is most
  visible in the part of its head. numerous horizontal sections cross the
  composition to represent this passive moment. the wooden board is mostly
  covered in black and shades of light brown, but energetic brushstrokes of
  green, blue and pink were added to refine the painting.
