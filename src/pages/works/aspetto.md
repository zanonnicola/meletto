description: >-
  translated as “i wait”, this particular painting was made in 2016 as part of
  the second collection. the subject is portrayed in two different moments at
  the same time, a feature that is most visible in the part of its head.
  numerous horizontal sections cross the composition to best represent the
  emotionally passive and static moment. the colour palette consists mostly in
  black, white and shades of light brown, but also energetic brushstrokes of
  green, blue and pink refine the entire painting.
