description: >-
  all shades of brown come together on this canvas made in 2009 as part of the
  first collection. this is a portrait of a person sitting on the ground at the
  bank of a river. several layers of dense brush strokes build the figure with
  colour and shape creating an ethereal and very elegant representation of the
  subject. the graphic style of this canvas was in part inspired by the
  aesthetic of the traditional asian art.
