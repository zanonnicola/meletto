description: >-
  translated “i don’t know you”, this composition is built around the subject as
  all the energetic brush strokes converge to the centre of its head. the figure
  is represented from above in a very close shot while it is staring at the
  viewer. it is graphically divided into four parts by strong oblique lines that
  cross the entire canvas.
